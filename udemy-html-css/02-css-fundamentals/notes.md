## üéì CSS: CSS Fundamentals

### üìù What is CSS?

- **CSS:** 
  - Cascading Style Sheets
  - CSS describes the visual style and presentation of the content written in HTML
  - CSS consists of countless properties that developers use to format the content:
    - properties about font, text, spacing, layout, etc.
- **Inline CSS:** 
  - Writing the css inside the element inside the html file
  - Should never be used
- **Internal CSS:** 
  - Declare style in the beginning of the folder
  - Write the css inside the style tag, inside the html file. <style></style>
- **External CSS:** 
  - Create an external file specifically used for styling.
  - Add file property to the html file

### üìù Classes and ID Selectors

- **Ids:** 
  - We can use the property id="" inside the html tag to give it a name and use it with # on the css file
  - Easier to change a specific part of the page
- **Class** 
  - The difference between id and class is that we can only use ids once.
  - Useful to use the same name multiple times
- **Pseudo-class** 
  - Selecting a specific inside a tag.
  - Example: li:first-child {
             font-weight: bold;
  - The tag type must be the first/last/nth child of that tag. 

### üìù Defining colors in CSS

- **RGB Model** 
  - Every color can be represented by a combination of Reg, Green and Blue
  - Each of the 3 base colors can take a value between 0 and 255, that's 16.8 million different colors
  - Example: rgb(0, 255, 255)
  - RGB with transparency ("alpha")
    - rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)
- **Hexadecimal Notation** 
  - Instead of using a scale from 0 to 255, we go from 0 to ff
  - Example: #00ffff #f4b33f #0ff
  - In practice, we mostly use hexadecimal colors, and rgba when we need transparency

- **Shades of Grey** 
  - When colors in all 3 channels are the same, we get a grey color
  - there are 256 pure grays to choose from
  - Example: rgb(69, 69, 69) #444444 #444 / rgb(183, 183, 183) #b7b7b7

- **Styling Links** 
  - LVHA (link, visited, hover, active)

### üìù Conflicting Declarations

- **Priority of selectors** 
  ! - Declarations marked !important
  0. Inline style (Style attribute in HTML)
  1. ID(#) selector
    - If there are multiple, the last selector in the code applies
  2. Class (.) or pseudo-class (:) selector
    - If there are multiple, the last selector in the code applies
  3. Element selector (p, div, li, etc.)
    - If there are multiple, the last selector in the code applies
  4. Universal selector (*)

### üìù Inheritance

- **Inheritance in CSS** 
  - Inheritance is a mechanism by which some styles/properties get their values inherited from parent elements to child elements
  - Not all properties can be inherited, mostly just text style ones
  - Inherited properties are very easily overwritten by higher priority declarations/selectors

### üìù The CSS Box Model
  - The box model defines how an element is going to be displayed on a web page

- **Parts of an element** 
  - Content
    - Text, images, etc.
    - width and height
  - Border
    - A line around the element, still inside of the element
  - Padding
    - Invisible space around the content, inside of the element (between the content and the border)
  - Marging
    - Space outside of the element, between elements
  - Fill Area
    - area that gets filled with background color or background image

- **Element Height and Width Calculation**
  - Final Element width: left border + left padding + width + right padding + right border
  - Final Element height: top border + top padding + height + bottom padding + bottom border
