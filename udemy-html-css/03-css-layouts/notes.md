## 🎓 LAYOUTS: Floats, Flexbox and CSS Grid Fundamentals

### 📝 What does Layout mean?

- **Layout**
  - Layout is the way text, images and other content is placed and arranged on a webpage
  - Layout gives the page a visual structure, into which we place our content
  - Building a layout: arranging page elements into a visual structure, instead of simply having them placed one after another (normal flow)

### 📝 Page layout vs. Component layout?

- **Page Layout**

  - Laying the pieces of content inside a webpage/web

- **Component Layout**
  - Page layouts are made of components, and they also need to have a layout

### 📝 The 3 ways of building layouts with CSS

- **Float layouts**

  - Old way of building layouts of all sizes, using the float CSS property. Still used but getting outdated fast.

- **Flexbox**

  - Modern way of laying out elements in a 1-dimensional row without using floats. Perfect for component layouts.

- **CSS Grid**
  - For laying out element in a fully-fledged 2-dimensional grid. Perfect for page layouts and complex components.

### 📝 Floats

- Element is removed from the normal flow: "out of flow" (just like absolute positioning)
- Text and inline elements will wrap around the floated element
- The container will not adjust its height to the element
